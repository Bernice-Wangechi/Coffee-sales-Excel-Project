### Project Overview
This project aimed to use coffee sales in the United States, Ireland, and the United Kingdom to answer some questions and provide insights to decision-makers. It is an interesting project because it answers some questions that people in coffee sales would have regarding the consumption of various coffee types.
I used data from [Mo Chen's Github](https://github.com/mochen862/excel-project-coffee-sales)

### Tools Used 
Microsoft Excel 

                - Data Cleaning 

                - Data analysis
                
                - Data Visualization 
### Data Cleaning/Preparation 
In this stage, I performed the following tasks 

                - Data loading and inspection to check for errors and blank values 
                
                - Removing duplicates and populating columns using INDEX() and MATCH() functions 
                
                - Making the readability of columns easier by writing certain words in full
                
                - Transforming the clean data range to a table for easier analysis 
### Exploratory Data Analysis 
Exploratory data analysis in my project involved asking questions like 

                - What was the overall sales trend like?
                
                - Which coffee brand was a best seller?
                
                - Which year had the best coffee sales?
                
                - Which country consumed more coffee?
### Data Analysis 
I analyzed my data using Pivot Tables in Microsoft Excel, and I could easily summarize and understand my data. 
I then visualized the data that I had analyzed using the Pivot Tables with Pivot Charts, which enabled me to see the coffee sales trends easily.
### Recommendations 
Based on the analysis that I conducted, I recommend 

               - Producing and marketing Excelsa more because it had the most sales, and is therefore more preferred

               - Sending more inventory to the United States, because it had significantly more sales than Ireland and the United Kingdom

               - Investing more in marketing because sales reduced significantly from 2021 to 2022

### Limitations
The data in 2022 was incomplete and ended in August, making it hard to do accurate comparisons for each year.
